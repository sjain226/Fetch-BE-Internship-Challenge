Part 2

1) For this coding assignment I used the programming language Python and framework Flask. Python is user friendly and easily readable making it easier to choose for this assignment to build REST API. It has a large number of libraries and frameworks available to work with. Flask is a framework in Python which helped to handle HTTP requests making it suitable for the following assignment. I used VS Code as an IDE as I am comfortable using it and have worked with it before. It offers a lot of python extensions and is easy to navigate. It's built in terminal makes it easy to run, debug and test code and works well with errors.

2) Advantages: Using python made my solution reader friendly and is pretty straightforward. I have also added try catch blocks to gracefully handle errors when calling the REST APIs. 
Disadvantages: My solution currently works for a single user and relies on in-memory data source. When we restart the server, it will initiate the data from scratch, with no memory of the previous session. I could've also added unit test cases to automate testing of my code, which would've made future and/or multi-user changes reliable.

3) I had the opportunity to contribute to a Post Stroke Recovery Application, where we employed gamification techniques to assist stroke victims. During this project, our team incorporated valuable feedback from 30 users following the initial release, marking my first engagement with a real-world project. Collaborating within a team context also exposed me to conflict resolution and data-driven decision-making. One notable instance occurred when we were developing a user authentication system. Two team members favored breaking down the tasks into user name, password, etc., while two, including myself, advocated for a monolithic approach. In advocating for the monolithic approach, I emphasized its simplicity and the ability to meet project deadlines effectively. Conversely, the other two members believed their approach would enhance system stability. After open communication, data-driven decision-making, cost-benefit analysis, and compromise, we decided to initiate the project with the monolithic approach to meet tight deadlines. We planned to transition to the other approach as the system expanded and required scalability. In summary, this experience marked my first professional encounter with product-related challenges and underscored the importance of collaborative problem-solving and adaptability in a professional setting. It enhanced my understanding of the significance of teamwork and flexibility in the workplace.
